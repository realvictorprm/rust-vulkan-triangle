# Creating a triangle with Vulkan in Rust
Following the tutorial or example in this [vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/resources/vulkan_tutorial_en.pdf), I've created this code.

Currently this still is work in progress.

Noteable things I learned are in my opinion the usage of macros to make my life with c strings a bit easier, as they always have to be backed up by an array.
